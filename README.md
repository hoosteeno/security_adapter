security_adapter
================

This code attempts to extract data (in JSON) from Mozilla security announcements (https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/) using BeautifulSoup. It depends on an SVN checkout of the advisory repository (https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/mozilla.org/trunk/security/announce). Right now it just prints output to STDOUT.
